## Automating game notifications with AWS
- The project involving fetching NBA game data from SportsData.io and sending notifications using AWS services, hereâ€™s a high-level approach you can follow:
1. Fetch NBA Game Data
API Integration: Use the SportsData.io API to fetch the NBA game data. You'll need to:

Sign up for an API key from SportsData.io.
Use the appropriate API endpoints to get the data you need (e.g., schedules, scores, player stats).
Data Handling: You might want to handle the data using a Lambda function that triggers at regular intervals (e.g., using CloudWatch Events).

2. Set Up AWS Services
AWS Lambda: Create a Lambda function to fetch data from SportsData.io and process it.

The Lambda function can be triggered by CloudWatch Events to run at scheduled times (e.g., every hour).
Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service): Use SNS to send notifications.

Once your Lambda function fetches and processes the data, it can publish a message to an SNS topic.
Subscribers to the SNS topic (e.g., email, SMS, or other Lambda functions) will receive the notifications.
Amazon S3 (Optional): If you need to store fetched data for future reference, you can save it in S3 buckets.

3. Notification Logic
Processing in Lambda: After fetching the game data, apply any logic you need to decide what notifications to send (e.g., game start times, final scores, specific player performances).

Publishing to SNS: Use the AWS SDK within the Lambda function to publish messages to your SNS topic based on the processed data.

4. Security and Cost Management
IAM Roles: Ensure your Lambda function has the necessary IAM role to access SportsData.io API and SNS.
Cost Management: Use AWS Free Tier and monitor your usage to keep costs in check.
5. Monitoring and Logging
Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the execution of your Lambda function and SNS topic.
Implement proper logging within your Lambda function to help debug and monitor data flow.
